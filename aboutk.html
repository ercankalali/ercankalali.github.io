		</span>
	</h1>	
	<p>I received the B.Sc. degree in Electronics Engineering from Istanbul Technical University (ITU), Istanbul, Turkey in 2011. I received M.Sc. and Ph.D. degrees in Electronics Engineering from Sabanci University, Istanbul, Turkey in 2013 and 2018, respectively. I was a research assistant at System on Chip (SoC) Design Lab, Sabanci University from 2011 to 2018. Also, I worked as a research/teaching assistant at the Istanbul Technical University between 2015 and 2019. Between August 2019 and March 2022, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the Delft University of Technology. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Researcher with the Electronic Systems group at the Eindhoven University of Technology.
	<br> <br>
	My research interests include low power digital hardware design, approximate computing, FPGAs, high-level synthesis, computer architecture, video coding, deep learning, sensor fusion, and neuromorphic computing.
